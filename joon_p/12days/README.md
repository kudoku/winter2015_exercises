Game of Life: I had a lot of trouble organizing my code and knowing what went where. My biggest challenge keeping track of the logic flow and organizing code. Using the debugger/print driven development, I was able to walk myself through the flow with help from carlos' solution. 

Animal Quiz: After many attempts, I realized my logic and design wasn't sound, although I had managed to have "working code" until then. I kept hitting this landmine of a logic no matter how many approaches I thought up. I had to walk myself through the ruby quiz solutions and tried to replicate them. They all used the binary search method, which I had to educate myself on before understanding the flow.

For both projects, I wish I had learned more about translating my logic/pseudocode into actual syntax. Finished DRY code skips too many steps and doesn't give very much insight into the actual translation of thought > code > refactor.  I kept repeatedly hitting logic landmines due to either inexperience with organizing code or no working knowledge of computer science(basic algorithms, logic flow).
